                <p style="color: rgb(224, 89, 10);font-size: large;">Mars, on average, lies roughly 140,000,000 miles from Earth. The atmosphere is 96 percent carbon dioxide. It’s also 100 times thinner than Earth’s, allowing dangerous amounts of UV rays, as well as meteors, to reach the surface. Huge dust storms roam the planet, carving out canyons and valleys from the rust-stained surface. The land is pockmarked by hundreds of thousands of meteor craters. It is a barren planet—a frozen wasteland completely devoid of life … except for one lone individual: The Martian.

                    The Martian is actually a man: a biologist/engineer/astronaut named Mark Watney. Stranded on Mars after a dust storm forces his crew to abandon him—and with all of Earth believing him to be dead—Watney must find a way to survive. While Watney is not the sole character in Andy Weir’s novel, he is the focal point of the story and, luckily, he is interesting enough to keep the reader engaged as the story progresses. His humor and ingenuity drive the novel, as he manages to overcome obstacle after obstacle with his clever ideas.
                    
                    However, I would not say that Watney is a particularly dynamic character. Neither his mental nor emotional state are truly investigated or developed apart from the occasional comment of panic or loneliness. For the most part, Watney is a wise-cracking, quick-thinking astronaut and nothing more. His character is fleshed out somewhat in his interactions with his crew members. Specifically, messages that he sends to them later in the novel reveal a more compassionate and serious side to his personality that is never really illustrated anywhere else.
                    
                    The story itself is entertaining, but often predictable. Weir manages to throw us a few curveballs, just as the reader begins to believe that Watney’s situation is safe and stable. These challenges that Watney endures help to entice the reader; however, the major plot twists are foreshadowed by a sudden shift to a third-person omnipotent narrator that feels awkward and unnecessary.
                    
                    The writing in general is somewhat bland, except for Watney’s humorous and colorful language. Also, most of the novel consists of Watney explaining nearly every detail of every situation that befalls him. Some may find this boring or annoying at times; personally, I found it to be fascinating. According to Weir, the entirety of the novel is scientifically accurate in theory. Readers looking for an action-packed, alien-filled novel such as H.G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds may be disappointed; however, The Martian is an entertaining novel that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a daring sci-fi adventure.
